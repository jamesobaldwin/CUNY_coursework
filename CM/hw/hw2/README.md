# CUNY Computational Methods Homework 2 due Thursday Sept 21

HW2 â€“ Exercise 5.3:
Consider the integral

$$ E(x) = \int^x_0 e^{-t^2} dt $$

a) Write a program to calculate E(x) for values of x from 0 to 3 in steps of 0.1. Choose for yourself what method you will use for performing the integral and a suitable number of slices. 
Report the value for x = 3 (e.g. as a comment in the python file or an output or comment in the jupyter notebook). 

b) When you are convinced your program is working, extend it further to make a graph of E(x) as a function of x.

Note that there is no known way to perform this particular integral analytically, so numerical approaches are the only way forward.
